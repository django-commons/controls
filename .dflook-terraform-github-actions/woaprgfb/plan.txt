Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # github_membership.this["danielm-cfa"] will be created
  + resource "github_membership" "this" {
      + downgrade_on_destroy = false
      + etag                 = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      + role                 = "member"
      + username             = "danielm-cfa"
    }

  # github_repository.this["controls"] will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "github_repository" "this" {
      ~ allow_squash_merge          = false -> true
      ~ delete_branch_on_merge      = false -> true
        id                          = "controls"
      + merge_commit_message        = "PR_TITLE"
      + merge_commit_title          = "MERGE_MESSAGE"
        name                        = "controls"
      + squash_merge_commit_message = "BLANK"
      + squash_merge_commit_title   = "PR_TITLE"
        # (31 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (1 unchanged block hidden)
    }

  # github_team_members.repo_team_members["django-commons-playground"] will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "github_team_members" "repo_team_members" {
        id      = "9757678"
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)

      + members {
          + role     = "member"
          + username = "danielm-cfa"
        }

        # (6 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 2 to change, 0 to destroy.
